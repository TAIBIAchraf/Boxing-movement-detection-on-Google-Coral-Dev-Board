# Introduction
Shadowboxing is a common tactic used in combat sports, especially boxing. This entails playing out a fight against an imaginary opponent, who is frequently represented by a shadow (thus the English word "shadow"). In shadowboxing, the practitioner moves, strikes, and defends in a manner similar to that of an actual fightâ€”just without a real partner in front of them. This project aims to develop a working prototype of an embedded system that can recognize boxing motions while a practitioner is shadowboxing. This project focuses on the jab, cross, and uppercut movements.

## How does it work ?
Built upon Google's PoseNet pose estimation model code, the original repository can be accessed via the following link: [project-posenet](https://github.com/google-coral/project-posenet).
I used it to extract keypoints and then conduct a purely analytical analysis of the movements to detect the boxing motions.
Begin by cloning this repository, then follow these steps:

Install all additional requirements for third-party libraries using the following command:
```
sh install_requirements.sh
```
To run the program, execute one of the following commands depending on your preferred resolution:
```bash
python3 pose_camera.py --res 480x360  # fast but low res
python3 pose_camera.py --res 640x480  # default
python3 pose_camera.py --res 1280x720 # slower but high res
```

And the output is also sent to the terminal:
